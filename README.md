This is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a digital showcase of my professional profile, including an "About Me" section, a detailed list of my technical skills, and contact information. The website features a clean, responsive design and interactive elements to enhance user experience. It's designed to reflect my personal style while providing potential employers or clients with a clear and accessible overview of who I am and what I can do.
